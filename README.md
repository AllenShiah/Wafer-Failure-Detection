# Wafer-Failure-Detection

Wafer failure usually implies the disfunction of machine and different types of failures result from different abnormalities. Therefore, it is meaningful to distinguish the differnt pattern in wafer failure. Below illustrates the typical failures in wafer. Our goal is to use deep learning methodology to classify these pattern.
